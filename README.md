# Analog Signal Analyzer

This project is designed to read and analyze analog signals using an Arduino board.

## How It Works

1. The Arduino reads a signal from an analog pin.
2. The obtained signal value is printed to the Serial Monitor.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable
- Analog sensor (e.g., potentiometer or other sensors)

## Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Download this repository.
3. Open the `src/main.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload it to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Open the Serial Monitor (set to 9600 baud).
2. Observe the analog signal readings.
